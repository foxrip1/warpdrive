# Warp Drive Management System

Welcome to the Warp Drive Management System, a powerful tool for managing and operating your spaceship's warp drive for real intergalactic travel.

## Features

- Allocate energy for the warp drive.
- Check for hazards and implement safety measures.
- Analyze gravitational fields and detect anomalies.
- Monitor the ship's position and travel through space and time.
- Continuously monitor and adjust warp field parameters.
- Simulate and test potential warp trajectories.
- Maintain a habitable environment during warp journeys.
- Diagnose and address warp drive issues.
- Establish ship-to-ship communication.
- Handle emergencies during warp travel.
- Execute a warp jump to reach your destination.
